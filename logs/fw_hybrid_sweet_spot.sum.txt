STRATEGY RATIONALE:
  fw_comprehensive_bypass loaded more extensively than fw_comprehensive_5layer_bypass
  This suggests there's a 'sweet spot' for validation bypass that maximizes loading extent

APPROACH:
  - Core patches: Proven OSD disable patterns (0x01 -> 0x00)
  - Selective validation: Only bypass what we're confident about
  - Minimal additional OSD: Avoid over-patching that might trigger new failures

PATCHES APPLIED:
  - Core OSD disable: 5 patches
  - Selective validation: 1 patches
  - Additional OSD: 3 patches
  - Total: 9 patches

EXPECTED RESULT:
  Device should load more extensively (like fw_comprehensive_bypass)
  while avoiding the over-patching issues of fw_comprehensive_5layer_bypass

Key Insight:
  More patches != better loading. There's a sweet spot for validation bypass.
