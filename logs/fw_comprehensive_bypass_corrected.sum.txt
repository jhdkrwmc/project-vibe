Comprehensive 4-Layer Integrity Bypass Strategy (CORRECTED)
Generated: 2025-08-13T03:42:40.320649

Strategy:
  Address ALL 4 layers of integrity validation with CORRECTED byte offsets:
  - Layer 1: OSD initialization writes (0x01 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 2: Extended OSD configuration (0x86 -> 0x00) - CORRECTED OFFSET
  - Layer 3: Validation logic expectations (0x84 -> 0x00) - CORRECTED OFFSETS
  - Layer 4: Additional validation checks (0x01 -> 0x00)

Key Insight from Clean IDA Pro Analysis:
  - Mixed FLIRTs were corrupting instruction decoding
  - Clean 8051 analysis revealed correct byte offsets
  - All 4 layers must be bypassed simultaneously for success

Layer 1 - OSD Initialization Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x04d4: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0ac8: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0b02: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x4526: 01 -> 00

Layer 2 - Extended OSD Configuration Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x032a: 86 -> 00

Layer 3 - Validation Logic Bypass Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0xb0e9: 84 -> 00
OK   @ 0xc6cc: 84 -> 00

Layer 4 - Additional Validation Check Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x0244: 01 -> 00

Total bytes changed: 8
Checksum: Not modified (original firmware has invalid checksum anyway)

Expected Result:
  Device should now pass ALL layers of integrity validation and complete USB configuration
  instead of stopping at Config=0 with Code 10 error.

Patch Strategy:
  - All OSD registers consistently set to 0x00
  - All validation logic expects 0x00 values
  - No inconsistent states that could trigger validation failures
  - Complete 4-layer bypass (not partial)
