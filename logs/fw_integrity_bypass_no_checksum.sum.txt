Integrity Check Bypass Strategy - No Checksum Fix
Generated: 2025-08-13T00:21:24.114564

Strategy:
  Instead of just patching OSD writes, we now patch the integrity check logic
  to expect 0x00 values instead of 0x01/0x84. This should allow the device
  to pass validation and complete USB configuration.

Key Insight:
  Original firmware has invalid checksum (0xC3A4) - checksum validation is NOT used.
  The device uses runtime integrity checks instead, which is what we're bypassing.

OSD Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x04d4: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0ac8: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0b02: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x4526: 01 -> 00

Integrity Check Bypass Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x0244: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0260: 84 -> 00

Total bytes changed: 6
Checksum: Not modified (original firmware has invalid checksum anyway)

Expected Result:
  Device should now pass integrity validation and complete USB configuration
  instead of stopping at Config=0 with Code 10 error.
