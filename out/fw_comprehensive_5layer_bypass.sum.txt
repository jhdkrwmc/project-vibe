Comprehensive 5-Layer Integrity Bypass Strategy
Generated: 2025-08-13T04:12:12.426897

BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY:
  Our 4-layer bypass was INCOMPLETE! Found a 5th layer with:
  - Additional OSD register writes (0x19, 0x1A, 0x1B, 0x11, 0x81, 0x84, 0x85)
  - Additional validation checks (0x07, 0x81, 0x84, 0x85)

Strategy:
  Apply ALL 5 layers of integrity validation bypass:
  - Layer 1: OSD initialization writes (0x01 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 2: Extended OSD configuration (0x86 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 3: Validation logic expectations (0x84 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 4: Additional validation checks (0x01 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 5: ADDITIONAL OSD REGISTER WRITES (0x19,0x1A,0x1B,0x11,0x81,0x84,0x85 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 5: ADDITIONAL VALIDATION CHECKS (0x07,0x81,0x84,0x85 -> 0x00)

Key Insight:
  Previous patches failed because we missed the 5th layer of protection.
  The firmware has more sophisticated validation than initially thought.

Total patches applied: 19
Total bytes changed: 19
Checksum: Not modified (original firmware has invalid checksum anyway)

Expected Result:
  Device should now pass ALL 5 layers of integrity validation
  and complete USB configuration instead of stopping at Config=0 with Code 10 error.

Patch Strategy:
  - All OSD registers consistently set to 0x00 across ALL layers
  - All validation logic expects 0x00 values across ALL layers
  - No inconsistent states that could trigger validation failures
  - Complete 5-layer bypass (not partial)
