Single-Flip Diagnostic Variant: 0x04D4
Generated: 2025-08-13T06:33:12.791641

STRATEGY:
  Test each OSD site individually to identify the critical path
  This variant changes ONLY 0x04D4 to isolate its effect

PATCH APPLIED:
  0x04D4: 0x01 -> 0x00
  Only 0x04D4 flipped - affects 0x0B77 (OSD data/mode)

INTEGRITY NOTE:
  No checksum/footer fix applied in this diagnostic build.

EXPECTED RESULT:
  If this single flip can boot clean, the issue is elsewhere.
  If it still gets Code 10, this site is on the critical path.

DIAGNOSTIC VALUE:
  Compare USB Tree Viewer results with other variants
  Look for differences in loading extent, Config values, etc.
