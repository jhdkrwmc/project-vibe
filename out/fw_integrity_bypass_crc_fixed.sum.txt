OSD Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x04d4: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0ac8: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0b02: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x4526: 01 -> 00

Integrity Check Bypass Patches Applied:
OK   @ 0x0244: 01 -> 00
OK   @ 0x0260: 84 -> 00

Checksum Calculation:
  Partial sum [0x0000..0x1FFD]: 0xc31c
  Computed checksum (two's complement): 0x3ce4
  Checksum bytes @ 0x1FFE..0x1FFF (LE): E4 3C
  Final 16-bit sum of entire image: 0x8450
  Verification: FAIL

Strategy:
  Instead of just patching OSD writes, we now patch the integrity check logic
  to expect 0x00 values instead of 0x01/0x84. This should allow the device
  to pass validation and complete USB configuration.
