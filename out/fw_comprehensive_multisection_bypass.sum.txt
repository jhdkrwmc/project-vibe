Comprehensive Multi-Section Integrity Bypass Strategy
Generated: 2025-08-13T03:59:06.072805

BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY:
  The firmware has 6 identical sections that must ALL be patched consistently:
  - Main section (0x0000-0x1FFF): 32KB
  - Section 1 (0x6000-0x7FFF): 8KB duplicate
  - Section 2 (0x8000-0x9FFF): 8KB duplicate
  - Section 3 (0xA000-0xBFFF): 8KB duplicate
  - Section 4 (0xC000-0xDFFF): 8KB duplicate
  - Section 5 (0xE000-0xFFFF): 8KB duplicate

Strategy:
  Apply ALL 4 layers of integrity validation bypass to ALL 6 sections:
  - Layer 1: OSD initialization writes (0x01 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 2: Extended OSD configuration (0x86 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 3: Validation logic expectations (0x84 -> 0x00)
  - Layer 4: Additional validation checks (0x01 -> 0x00)

Key Insight:
  Previous patches failed because only the main section was modified.
  The duplicate sections remained unchanged, creating inconsistency
  that triggered additional validation failures.

Total patches applied: 48
Total bytes changed: 48
Checksum: Not modified (original firmware has invalid checksum anyway)

Expected Result:
  Device should now pass ALL layers of integrity validation across ALL sections
  and complete USB configuration instead of stopping at Config=0 with Code 10 error.

Patch Strategy:
  - All OSD registers consistently set to 0x00 across ALL sections
  - All validation logic expects 0x00 values across ALL sections
  - No inconsistent states that could trigger validation failures
  - Complete multi-section 4-layer bypass (not partial)
