FW_A (firmware_backup_base.bin) Stub Site Selection
==================================================

CHOSEN STUB LOCATION
--------------------
Address: 0xFFE0
Size Available: 32 bytes
Type: 0x00 padding area

RATIONALE
---------
1. Post-integrity execution (safe timing)
2. Not in computed jump tables
3. Not in misaligned jump targets
4. Large padding area (32 bytes of 0x00)
5. Easy to identify and verify

CAVE EVIDENCE
-------------
Area 0xFFE0-0xFFFF analysis:
0xFFE0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0xFFF0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

STUB REQUIREMENTS
----------------
OSD-off stub needs approximately 20 bytes:
- PUSH instructions (6 bytes)
- MOV DPTR,#0x0E24 (3 bytes)
- MOV A,#0x00 (2 bytes)
- MOVX @DPTR,A (1 byte)
- POP instructions (6 bytes)
- RET (1 byte)
- Total: ~19 bytes

AVAILABILITY
-----------
✅ 0xFFE0-0xFFFF: 32 bytes of 0x00 padding
✅ Total space: 32 bytes (more than sufficient)

SAFETY ASSESSMENT
-----------------
✅ Not in computed jump island
✅ Not in misaligned jump targets
✅ Post-integrity execution
✅ Large padding space
✅ Easy to verify and restore

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Use 0xFFE0 as stub location with 20-byte allocation.
This provides ample space for the OSD-off stub while maintaining safety.
