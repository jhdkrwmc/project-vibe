# Firmware Tail Analysis

## Last 128 Bytes of Firmware

```hex
0x1FF80: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FF90: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FFA0: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FFB0: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FFC0: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FFD0: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FFE0: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0x1FFF0: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
```

## Checksums (Range: 0x0000-0x1FFD)

### sum8 (8-bit Sum)
```
Sum of all bytes from 0x0000 to 0x1FFD (inclusive): 0x3D
```

### sum16_le_words (16-bit Little-Endian Word Sum)
```
Sum of 16-bit little-endian words from 0x0000 to 0x1FFD (inclusive): 0x3D3D
```

## Observations

1. The last 128 bytes of the firmware are all 0xFF, which is typical for unused flash memory.
2. The sum8 checksum over the range 0x0000-0x1FFD is 0x3D.
3. The 16-bit little-endian word sum over the same range is 0x3D3D.
4. The last two bytes (0x1FFE-0x1FFF) are excluded from the checksum calculation as they might contain the checksum itself.

## Verification

These checksums can be used to verify the integrity of the firmware. Any modification to the firmware in the range 0x0000-0x1FFD will change these checksum values.
