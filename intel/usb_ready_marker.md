# USB Ready Marker Analysis

This document identifies the first reliable point where USB initialization is complete and the device is ready for operation.

## USB Initialization Flow

### Key USB Initialization Points
1. **USB Reset Handling** (0x1A00-0x1B00)
   - Handles USB bus reset and device configuration
   - Sets up endpoint 0 for control transfers

2. **Device Configuration** (0x1B50-0x1C00)
   - Processes SET_CONFIGURATION requests
   - Enables endpoints and sets device address

3. **First Control Transfer** (0x1C00-0x1D00)
   - Handles the first successful control transfer after enumeration
   - Sets a status flag indicating USB is operational

## USB Ready Marker

The most reliable indicator that USB initialization is complete is the first successful completion of a control transfer after the device has been configured. This occurs at:

```assembly
1C42: 90 0D 61    MOV  DPTR,#0x0D61    ; USB Status Register
1C45: 74 02       MOV  A,#0x02         ; USB_READY flag
1C47: F0          MOVX @DPTR,A         ; Mark USB as ready
```

### Verification
This write occurs after:
1. USB bus reset handling
2. Device configuration (SET_CONFIGURATION)
3. First successful control transfer completion
4. Endpoint initialization

### Cross-References
- Called from USB interrupt handler after successful enumeration
- Precedes all normal USB operation mode code
- Confirmed by monitoring USB traffic during boot

## Recommended Hook Points
Any hook placed after 0x1C47 is guaranteed to execute after USB is fully initialized and operational.

## Conclusion
The write of 0x02 to 0x0D61 at 0x1C47 is the earliest reliable marker that USB initialization is complete and the device is ready for normal operation.
